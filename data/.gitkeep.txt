# This folder stores raw input data for the project.
# Replace these CSVs with your exported WaterGEMS FlexTables:
# - Junction Table.csv
# - Pipe Table.csv
# - Pump Table.csv
# - Reservoir Table.csv
# 
# Each file should include consistent headers such as:
#   Label, Elevation (m), Demand (L/s), Hydraulic Grade (m), Pressure (m H2O)
# for Junctions, and corresponding attributes for Pipes, Pumps, and Reservoirs.
